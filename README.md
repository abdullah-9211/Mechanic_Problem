Cater problems for a mechanic shop
Problem is as stated:-
"a car comes into the shop. there are 3 types of services a mechanic can perform:
50k service, 100k service and 200k service. 50k service has 5 questions, 100k has 6 and 200k has 7. each question is a Compliant/ Non-Compliant choice question
and with every Non-Compliant answer, a user must also write a comment against it. make an app."
This was a console based application made in C# and catered to this problem. All responses recorded were stored in files.
Respondant also got the option to tell if they didn't like their response and could submit again.
